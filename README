This work is a collaboration between Dan Friedman and Chris Frisz to
hopefully make Clojure super awesome by implementing tail call
optimization. 

Herein lies a lot of musings by me, Chris, working through first
principles to get to a point where arbitrary Clojure programs can be
CPSed and trampolined for accommodating tail recursive programs in a
hostile environment.
